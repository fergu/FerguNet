			Welcome to Fergu.net, the personal webpage of Kevin Ferguson. This site is intended as a brief overview of who I am, what I do for a living, and my current professional goals. It is, of course, extremely difficult to summarize everything that makes me, me in a few web pages, and it's completely understandable to not be inclined to read the paragraphs below, so if you're interested in learning more please head over to the <a href="contact.html">contact</a> page to send me an email. I would be more than happy to set up a meeting via phone call, zoom, or just an email correspondence.<br>

			I am a Ph.D candidate in Aerospace Engineering with a research emphasis on Fluid Mechanics and a Ph.D minor in Applied Mathematics, nearing the completion of my program with an expected graduation date somewhere in the spring semester of 2022. I am currently on the search for a PostDoc (or just a regular job), with hopes to further expand in to my fields of interest, including atmospheric science and fluid turbulence. For more information about both my existing skills and my interests please check my <a href="resume.html">Resume</a> page.<br>
			My Ph.D research is centered around an experimental study of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richtmyer%E2%80%93Meshkov_instability">Richtmyer-Meshkov instability</a> in the Fluid Mechanics and Instability Lab at the University of Arizona. My research, specifically, is focused on using the Particle-Image Velocimetry (PIV) technique to examine the behavior of the RMI in reshock. These experiments are being conducted in a new dual-driver vertical shock tube (DDVST), which was designed and built as part of my Ph.D work. The shock tube was computationally optimized during the design stage to achieve the longest possible post-reshock growth period within the physical constraints of our lab. Experimental campaigns have included utilizing the DDVST's ability to halt bulk interface motion post-reshock to gather high resolution, high speed PIV data of the RMI, and a second campaign has focused on using the DDVST's ability to independently control the arrival times of the first (incident) and second (reshock) shock waves to control the period of time between the arrival of shock and reshock and examine its influence on the post-reshock growth behavior. More information can be found in my <a href="resume.html">resume</a> under the papers, posters, and talks section, or by contacting me directly with questions.

			Of course, as intensive as a Ph.D program can be I do not exist solely as a researcher. I currently live at home with my cat, Nimbus. I have a wide range of interests that are unrelated to my educational persuits. These range from a passion for DIY projects to make my life (and the lives of others) a bit easier, to development of both mobile and desktop applications to serve a specific need, to simply experimenting with a new recipe in the kitchen. A small subset of these projects are outlined on the <a href="projects.html">projects</a> page. I seem to always have a few projects in the works at any given time. They don't always come to fruition but the process of trying, failing, and trying again I find to be cathartic and particularly rewarding when a tough project finally sees the light of day. It provides an excellent distraction from the stresses of work and daily life, and I have often found that the solution to a vexing problem seems to appear when you are preoccupied with another task.<br>

			I am also a fan of the outdoors and like to go camping and hiking as my schedule allows. I was a whitewater river guide during high school, and though it has been many years since I've been out in whitewater, owing in part to Arizona's famous lack of (survivable) whitewater, I still welcome any opportunity to spend the day out in nature. Here in Tucson I tend to visit the top of the nearby Mt. Lemmon to spend the day in cooler temperatures and a more verdant surrounding. It continually amazes me how much the desert landscape can change even in a short 45 minute, 20 mile drive. The pictures to the left and right of this paragraph show me at a camp site with some friends (left) and at the Windy Point Vista, located about halfway up the Catalina highway, providing a gorgeous overview of the city of Tucson while enjoying temperatures that can be more than 20F lower than in the city, making it an excellent summer escape.<br>
			Unfortunately this same area frequently experiences severe wildfires due to the increasing dry desert climate. For  this reason I am passionate about conservation and stewardship of our natural resources. I do my best to not only "leave it cleaner than I found it" when out in nature, but to be mindful of the ecological impact my day-to-day actions may have, including minimizing the amount of driving I do, reusing and recycling where possible, and ensuring things are disposed of in a proper way. I also advocate for similar actions from those around me and, where possible, from my local government.
