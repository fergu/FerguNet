		I am a firm believer that most DIY projects should be undertaken to expand one's skills, to create something new, or just for the fun of it. Only rarely does DIY-ing something end up being cheaper or less time-intensive than simply buying an off-the-shelf solution. That said, DIY projects represent a way that I can de-stress and unwind from real-world responsibilities by occupying both my mind and body with solving the problem in front of me. These are just a few examples of projects I have completed. Pictures of these projects are upcoming!.<p>

		<h1>Physical Projects</h1>
		These are projects that I have designed and built that resulted in some sort of physical product - furniture, devices, tools, and so on. These projects are particularly useful as they let me expand my working knowledge of the design concepts and fabrication techniques on something I can hold in my hands and use at the end of the project. This is especially insightful as the shortcomings of a design or technique and how they might be improved quickly become evident when you're the one using the thing you create.

					<div class='section-title'>The cat box</div>
				</div>
				<div class='section-content'>
					The 'cat box' is an affectionate name I gave to this dresser-sized box I built. The box is wood and is hollow on the inside with plywood sheets making up the surface. The box's interior is large enough to accomodate a covered cat litter box with room to remove it for cleaning via a front door. A secondary cabinet allows for storage of things such as waste bags and additional supplies<br>
					The purpose of the cat box is to lessen the dust and odors associated with a litter box. It also has the added benefit of reducing the litter tracked in to my apartment by my cat as most of it gets caught on a piece of scrap carpet located inside the box.

					<div class='section-title'>Custom Server Rack</div>
				</div>
				<div class='section-content'>
					This is a custom-designed and built server rack to hold my various home eletronics. This includes a 4U server chassis that houses my home server, various networking gear (router, modem, wireless AP, etc), and smart home bridges, as well as a power strip/surge protector to provide power to these items.<br>
					This was another "I wonder if I can do it" project, partially while looking for projects as the COVID-19 pandemic necessitated lockdowns. My original plan was to purchase an off-the-shelf server rack sufficient for home use, but it turned out that these are both very expensive and substantially overbuilt for my needs. This seemed like a prime candidate for a DIY project - something which would test my existing skills and allow me to create something that is otherwise hard to find that meets my needs.<br>
					The rack consists of a box frame that was built out of 2040 aluminum extrusions, and the side panels are cedar planks that were assembled and routed to slide in to the channels in the aluminum extrusion. The rack rails are also attached to the extrusion frame, offering substantial weight capacity. The rack also has 4 caster wheels mounted to the bottom to facilitate moving the rack around as needed.

					This website was designed and built by me from the ground up using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The primary goal was just to gain the experience of building a website and to see if it was something I chould achieve. The site is hosted via Github Pages.

					<a href="https://fergu.github.io/WindTunnel/" target="_blank">Check it out!</a><p>
					A simple website that solves the potential flow equations for 2D flow around a cylinder and then utilizes a conformal mapping technique to map the result to flow around an airfoil at an arbitrary angle of attack. Designed primarily as a visualization tool to to help younger audiences visualize the flow around a wing.<p>
					Further improvements are in progress. Eventual goal is to implement a GPU shader-based simulation of the Navier-Stokes equations for this same physical configuration to make the resulting flow visualization both look and behave more realistically, including boundary layers, flow separation, etc. For example, see <a href="https://haxiomic.github.io/GPU-Fluid-Experiments/html5/" target="_blank">Haxiomic's GPU Fluids Simulation</a>.
