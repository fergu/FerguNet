		<h2><b>Physical Projects</b></h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Masters Thesis: 3D Imaging Apparatus (August 2012 to May 2014)</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Created as part of my work on my Masters Thesis in Aerospace Engineering at the University of Arizona.</li>
				<li>Goal: design and implement a mechanism to capture the initial conditions of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richtmyerâ€“Meshkov_instability">Richtmyer-Meshkov fluid instability</a> (RMI) prior to shock wave arrival.</li>
				<li>Accomplished using a device known as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galvanometer">Galvanometer</a> with attached mirrors, combined with an Arduino Mega and 8-bit DAC with custom-designed PCB for current control.</li>
				<li>Demonstrated successfully and used to capture several experiments, which were then used for computational simulations of the instability.</li>
				<li>Subsequent improvements in the form of faster galvanometers and better mirror coatings have further improved results.</li>
			</ul>
			<li>Senior Capstone Design: Joined Wing UAV (August 2011 to May 2012)</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Created to satisfy requirements of the senior capstone design project, required for graduation from the University of Arizona's Aerospace Engineering program</li>
				<li>Chief Responsibilities: Team Lead and Aircraft Aerodynamic Design and planform sizing</li>
				<li>Goal: Design and construct an unmanned aerial vehicle with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed_wing">Joined Wing</a> design, featuring a continuous loop between the primary and secondary lifting surfaces</li>
				<li>Advantages include reduced structual weight, additional payload capacity, and greater aerodynamic efficiency due to reduction of trailing vorticies</li>
				<li>Successfully designed, built, and flight tested. Initial measurements agree with expected aerodynamic performance</li>
				<li>Improvements to be made in the form of additional motors, as well as refined winglet and structural design to reduce drag and weight</li>
