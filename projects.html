					<div class='section-title'>Masters Thesis: 3D Imaging Apparatus (August 2012 to May 2014)</div>
				</div>
				<div class='section-content'>
					Created as part of my work on my Masters Thesis in Aerospace Engineering at the University of Arizona.<br>
					Goal: design and implement a mechanism to capture the initial conditions of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richtmyerâ€“Meshkov_instability">Richtmyer-Meshkov fluid instability</a> (RMI) prior to shock wave arrival.<br>
					Accomplished using a device known as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galvanometer">Galvanometer</a> with attached mirrors, combined with an Arduino Mega and 8-bit DAC with custom-designed PCB for current control.<br>
					Demonstrated successfully and used to capture several experiments, which were then used for computational simulations of the instability.<br>
					Subsequent improvements in the form of faster galvanometers and better mirror coatings have further improved results.<br>

					<div class='section-title'>Senior Capstone Design: Joined Wing UAV (August 2011 to May 2012)</div>
				</div>
				<div class='section-content'>
					Created to satisfy requirements of the senior capstone design project, required for graduation from the University of Arizona's Aerospace Engineering program<br>
					Chief Responsibilities: Team Lead and Aircraft Aerodynamic Design and planform sizing<br>
					Goal: Design and construct an unmanned aerial vehicle with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed_wing">Joined Wing</a> design, featuring a continuous loop between the primary and secondary lifting surfaces<br>
					Advantages include reduced structual weight, additional payload capacity, and greater aerodynamic efficiency due to reduction of trailing vorticies<br>
					Successfully designed, built, and flight tested. Initial measurements agree with expected aerodynamic performance<br>
					Improvements to be made in the form of additional motors, as well as refined winglet and structural design to reduce drag and weight<br>

					This website was designed and built by me from the ground up using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The primary goal was just to gain the experience of building a website and to see if it was something I chould achieve. The site is hosted via Github Pages.
