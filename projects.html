		I am a firm believer that most DIY projects should be undertaken to expand one's skills, to create something new, or just for the fun of it. Only rarely does DIY-ing something end up being cheaper or less time-intensive than simply buying an off-the-shelf solution. That said, DIY projects represent a way that I can de-stress and unwind from real-world responsibilities by occupying both my mind and body with solving the problem in front of me. These are just a few examples of projects I have completed.<p>

		<h1>Physical Projects</h1>
		These are projects that I have designed and built that resulted in some sort of physical product - furniture, devices, tools, and so on. These projects are particularly useful as they let me expand my working knowledge of the design concepts and fabrication techniques on something I can hold in my hands and use at the end of the project. This is especially insightful as the shortcomings of a design or technique and how they might be improved quickly become evident when you're the one using the thing you create.

					<div class='section-title'>Masters Thesis: 3D Imaging Apparatus (August 2012 to May 2014)</div>
				</div>
				<div class='section-content'>
					Created as part of my work on my Masters Thesis in Aerospace Engineering at the University of Arizona.<br>
					Goal: design and implement a mechanism to capture the initial conditions of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richtmyer%E2%80%93Meshkov_instability">Richtmyer-Meshkov fluid instability</a> (RMI) prior to shock wave arrival.<br>
					Accomplished using a device known as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galvanometer">Galvanometer</a> with attached mirrors, combined with an Arduino Mega and 8-bit DAC with custom-designed PCB for current control.<br>
					Demonstrated successfully and used to capture several experiments, which were then used for computational simulations of the instability.<br>
					Subsequent improvements in the form of faster galvanometers and better mirror coatings have further improved results.<br>

					<div class='section-title'>Senior Capstone Design: Joined Wing UAV (August 2011 to May 2012)</div>
				</div>
				<div class='section-content'>
					Created to satisfy requirements of the senior capstone design project, required for graduation from the University of Arizona's Aerospace Engineering program<br>
					Chief Responsibilities: Team Lead and Aircraft Aerodynamic Design and planform sizing<br>
					Goal: Design and construct an unmanned aerial vehicle with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed_wing">Joined Wing</a> design, featuring a continuous loop between the primary and secondary lifting surfaces<br>
					Advantages include reduced structual weight, additional payload capacity, and greater aerodynamic efficiency due to reduction of trailing vorticies<br>
					Successfully designed, built, and flight tested. Initial measurements agree with expected aerodynamic performance<br>
					Improvements to be made in the form of additional motors, as well as refined winglet and structural design to reduce drag and weight<br>

					<div class='section-title'>The cat box</div>
				</div>
				<div class='section-content'>
					The 'cat box' is an affectionate name I gave to this dresser-sized box I built. The box is wood and is hollow on the inside with plywood sheets making up the surface. The box's interior is large enough to accomodate a covered cat litter box with room to remove it for cleaning via a front door. A secondary cabinet allows for storage of things such as waste bags and additional supplies<br>
					The purpose of the cat box is to lessen the dust and odors associated with a litter box. It also has the added benefit of reducing the litter tracked in to my apartment by my cat as most of it gets caught on a piece of scrap carpet located inside the box.

					<div class='section-title'>Custom Server Rack</div>
				</div>
				<div class='section-content'>
					This is a custom-designed and built server rack to hold my various home eletronics. This includes a 4U server chassis that houses my home server, various networking gear (router, modem, wireless AP, etc), and smart home bridges, as well as a power strip/surge protector to provide power to these items.<br>
					This was another "I wonder if I can do it" project, partially while looking for projects as the COVID-19 pandemic necessitated lockdowns. My original plan was to purchase an off-the-shelf server rack sufficient for home use, but it turned out that these are both very expensive and substantially overbuilt for my needs. This seemed like a prime candidate for a DIY project - something which would test my existing skills and allow me to create something that is otherwise hard to find that meets my needs.<br>
					The rack consists of a box frame that was built out of 2040 aluminum extrusions, and the side panels are cedar planks that were assembled and routed to slide in to the channels in the aluminum extrusion. The rack rails are also attached to the extrusion frame, offering substantial weight capacity. The rack also has 4 caster wheels mounted to the bottom to facilitate moving the rack around as needed.
