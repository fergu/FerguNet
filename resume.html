							Work includes the design and construction of a Dual-Driver Vertical Shock Tube (DDVST). Experiments conducted include high-resolution, high-speed studies of the Richtmyer-Meshkov Instability (RMI), and a separate experimental campaign focused on the influence of varying the period of time between the arrival of the incident shock and the second shock (reshock) on the post-reshock RMI behavior. Diagnostics have primarily consisted of laser-based Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV), with a handful of experiments utilizing a Mie scattering diagnostic.<br>

					<div class='section-title'>Research Interests</div>
				</div>
				<div class='section-content'>
					My research interests broadly fall within the field of Fluid Mechanics. More narrowly, I have a few specific interests that I hope to explore moving forward. While my existing experience has me very well versed in certain aspects of fluid mechanics, some of these are topics that I would like to use my existing experience to branch in to versus having already had this experience in the past.<br><br>
					<div class='section-split'>
						<div class='section-split-left'>
							Atmospheric Science &amp Mesoscale Modeling
						</div>
						<div class='section-split-right'>
							My interests here primarily are focused on the modeling and prediction of mesoscale meteorological processes. I am particularly interested in studying the factors which influence the generation of severe weather systems and tornadoes, though general sensitivity analysis and examination of potential factors of influence, especially as those factors may be influence by climate change, are of general interest.
						</div>
					</div><hr>
					<div class='section-split'>
						<div class='section-split-left'>
							Turbulence &amp Turbulent Mixing
						</div>
						<div class='section-split-right'>
							This field is directly related to my Masters and Ph.D work. Turbulence is clearly a very broad field with applications in an immense range of physical and engineering contexts which makes it difficult to identify a single problem or subfield of interest. I am interested in continued study in the same vein as my Ph.D research, including sensitivity analysis of the influence of initial conditions on the final turbulent state. 
						</div>
					</div><hr>
					<div class='section-split'>
						<div class='section-split-left'>
							Machine Learning in Fluid Mechanics
						</div>
						<div class='section-split-right'>
							Fluid mechanics, especially in turbulence, is a highly non-linear and chaotic process which defies many attempts for direct solutions or numerical integration. Numerical solutions in particular struggle with the sheer computational cost to achieve sufficient resolution within a simulation to fully resolve all the relevant flow features for more than moderate Reynolds numbers. Machine learning is another tool with potential application to simplifying these complex systems, including in the generation of turbulence models and prediction of the behavior of highly nonlinear and complex systems, especially those of our atmosphere and within complex engineering designs. It is only relatively recently that Machine Learning has begun to emerge as a topic of broad interest and I believe there are many un-realized potential applications of this technlogy to the problems of fluid mechanics. 
						</div>
					</div><hr>
					<div class='section-split'>
						<div class='section-split-left'>
							Open Source Development &amp Collaboration
						</div>
						<div class='section-split-right'>
							This topic is slightly different from the rest on this page in that it is not directly related to fluid mechanics. That said, I have a strong interest in the exploration and utilization of the explosion of various digital technologies and internet mediums to facilitate better collaboration and transparency in scientific data. Obviously not all data can be readily shared due to security or IP implications, but often the tools, scripts, and methods can be. The ability for the scientific community as a whole to collaborate and agree on standards for data exchange and collaboration has many possible benefits for improved quality control and scientific progress as a whole.
